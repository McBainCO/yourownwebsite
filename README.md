# Achieve fame and glory, expand your personal brand, and live your wildest dreams by building a free GitHub powered website!

_Based on [@barryclark's Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository and awesome [article on Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)._

You don't have your own website? üò±

Not to worry, let's get to work!

![silicon valley apple getting eaten by russ](http://i.giphy.com/xT0GqrBXjVVBJajQNG.gif)

## 1. Create a Github Account

### [github.com/join](github.com/join)

If a brand new account, make sure you verify your email with github.

## 2. Copy the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo. 

In Github terms a copy is called a 'fork' so you need to fork the repo. Look for the üç¥ button in the upper right.

## 3. Rename the repo to your `<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io`

Click on **Settings**. Follow the exact process from the following image if you are stuck:

## 4. Edit a(ny) file

Github is taking our "raw" files and turning them into HTML for us. 
We need to edit a file so Github knows to rebuild our site.

The best one to start with involves the configuration of your new site - the name, description, etc.
Click on the `_config.yml` file then hit the üñä icon to edit the file in your browser.
`https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml`

You can change anything you want, but the following are a good start:

### Saving your changes

In git, "committing" the change means you are saving it. It's a good idea to include a helpful message to yourself about what you did.
I like to write **Why** I made the change in the subject line and more info on **What** or **How** I did it below.

_For more info on what is happening behind the scenes, check out [Github's own documentation on Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [more about Jekyll, the open source "static site generator"](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) that makes this all possible._

## 5. Create a new post

We're almost there. Now we just need some sweet, sweet content!

### What are these `.md` files?
Posts (and most other files in our new repository) are written in Markdown, a lightweight text markup format (get it?). Hence the `.md` extension on these files. Our mostly plain text looking files will be turned into HTML that way.
[Github's guide to markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) is a good resource.

### Let's create one.
Create a file in the `_posts` folder. It needs a specific name - `YYYY-MM-DD-<TITLE-OF-POST-GOES-HERE.md>`.
You can also start by editing the default **Hello World** post.

#### 6. Check out your site at `https://<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io`!

**Congratulations, you are awesome!**

## Now what?

Write blog posts, post interesting links, share it with your friends and family so you can...

#### Achieve fame and glory

## Seriously, where to go from here?

Excellent question.

* If you want to learn more about your options using Github, explore [this document on different ways to setup Github pages ](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/). For example, you can create an organization and host a site that way. Say you volunteer at a local food kitchen, you can create an organization in Github called **LocalFoodSharers** and host a site under their name (versus using your own username).
* Or, take a look at Github's info on [customizing Github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/customizing-github-pages/).
* If you want to tweak the look of your site, or what it can do, you'll want to learn more about Jekyll. Check out [Jekyll Casts](http://jekyll.tips/) - "Step by step tutorials and screencasts covering everything you need to know about Jekyll."
* Speaking of, you'll probably [want to start running Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) so that you don't have to edit files directly using the Github web app.
* You'll need to interact with Github using git, the version control system. [This course from CodeSchool covers the basics](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) in a fun fashion. Seriously, CodeSchool does a great job at breaking down information.
* Ask! [Post a question here](https://github.com/threecommas/yourownwebsite/issues) or shoot me an email. Ask your favorite developer friend for help or to find out why something works the way it does.
