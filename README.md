# Achieve fame and glory, expand your personal brand, and live your wildest dreams by building a free GitHub powered website!

_Based on [@barryclark's Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository and awesome instructions._

You don't have your own website? ðŸ˜±

Not to worry, let's get to work!

## Create a Github Account

### [github.com/join](github.com/join)

#### 1. If a brand new account, make sure you verify your email with github.

#### 2. Copy the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo. 

In Github terms a copy is called a 'fork' so you need to fork the repo.

#### 3. Rename the repo to your `<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io` by clicking on **Settings**. Follow the exact process from the following image if you are stuck:

#### 4. Edit a file

Github is taking our "raw" files and turning them into HTML for us. 
We need to edit a file so Github knows to rebuild our site.

Click on the `_config.yml` file then hit the ðŸ–Š icon to edit the file in your browser.
`https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml`

You can change anything you want, but the following are a good start:

In git, "committing" the change means you are saving it. It's a good idea to include a helpful message to yourself about what you did.
I like to write **Why** I made the change in the subject line and more info on **What** or **How** I did it below.

_For more info on what is happening behind the scenes, check out [Github's own documentation on Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [more about Jekyll, the open source "static site generator"](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) that makes this all possible.

#### 5. Create a new post

We're almost there. Now we just need some sweet, sweet content!
Create a file in the `_posts` folder. Or, edit the default **Hello World** post.

#### 6. Check out your site at `https://<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io`!

**Congratulations, you are awesome!**
